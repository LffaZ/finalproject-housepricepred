# House Price Prediction using Random Forest Regression Model

### Project Overview  
This project aims to predict house prices in King County using a Random Forest model. The dataset which was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) includes 21,613 data points and 21 features. These characteristics reflect different facets of the properties that affect home values.

### Project Goals
- Build a Random Forest model to predict house prices.
- Improve model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters using Grid Search.
- Analyze the relationships between different features and their impact on model accuracy.

### Methodology  
1. **Data Accessing**
2. **Data Cleaning**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Feature Engineering**
5. **Modeling**: Random Forest Regression
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

### Project Key Insights  
- A strong 0.70 correlation was found between house prices and sqft living highlighting its significant impact on price predictions.
- The **best parameters** identified using Grid Search, significantly improved the model's performance with `n_estimators` set to 200 and `max_depth` set to 20.
- The model achieved a high **RÂ² value of 0.96**, demonstrating its strong ability to predict house prices accurately.
